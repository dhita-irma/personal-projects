            Is this your very first trip to Bali? Unsure of where to go? <br><br>
            On this sunny island with anything and everything (trust us, the most impossible things can happen here!),
            it can be
            challenging to plan a short getaway when you want to cover the mountains and the seas, the beaches and the
            rainforests
            and all the strange and random little nooks and crannies that make Bali well, Bali.
            So our advice is – take it slow, Bali may be an island but it’s nearly 5 times the size of Singapore, so
            you’re going to
            have a crazy ride (in the literal sense) if you want to see everything there is to see in Bali during a
            5-days-4-nights
            holiday.

                                Try to arrive early since you only have 3 days to visit this beautiful island, and stay
                                in one of the strategic places
                                in central or south of Bali. Hire a car in advance and use it to head straight to two of
                                the most famous temples in
                                Bali. First head to Uluwatu Temple and double back to Tanah Lot Temple, in time to enjoy
                                the amazing sunset there. If
                                you are also in time, catch the famous Kecak Dance here that is set against the backdrop
                                of this beautiful temple. End
                                the day with a good dinner at Ultimo in Seminyak.

                                Ubud is the place one must explore when in Bali. Walk around the city would be a
                                delight, there are many boutiques to
                                shop around, spas and massages to pamper yourself and art or attractions to visit. Next,
                                head out to the north to the
                                neighbor town of Tegalalang to find classic rice terraces of Asia. Many tourists also
                                like to stay in Ubud * as it is
                                quite central to many of the attractions around Bali and yet away from the crowd in
                                Kuta. After visiting Ubud, choose
                                one of the beaches in Bali and get some swim and tan, popular choices are Balangan or
                                Padang-padang beach. At sunset,
                                head to Jimbaran and enjoy a seaside romantic dining.

                                Depending on how much time you have left, you may squeeze in one of two more things
                                before heading to the airport for
                                your departure. If you still want to explore more of Bali’s amazing temples, then I
                                would recommend the Pura Ulun Danu
                                Bratan, a beautiful mirrored temple by the lake. Or if you would prefer to pack in some
                                last-minute shopping, there are
                                few shopping places in Bali. Or if you still have not enough of the beaches, you know
                                where to find more beautiful
                                beaches in Bali to hang out.

                                head to Kuta beach and get some suntan and swimming in. If you have the time, you may sneak in some surf lessons here.
                                After that, check out Kuta’s vibrant nightlife. There are also of course a lot of selection of places to stay in Kuta.

                                After the hectic day from yesterday, it is a good time to check out some of the best beaches of Bali. Choose one to your
                                delight and head there for some relaxation. Chill on white sand beaches, swim or snorkel in clear blue sea and get some
                                holiday tan. One of the few you can check out is Balangan beach or Padang-padang beach. Toward evening head to Jimbaran
                                for a seaside romantic dinner. If you are in this area, don’t forget to check out the rock bar at RIMBA Jimbaran Bali by

                                after, chill at the black sand beach. Then head on to the underrated Pura Ulun Danu Bratan, an impressive temple by the
                                lake. This is one of the most important temples in Bali. After that, you can head further west to Mount Batur for a view
                                or if you prefer a hike up and then end the northern loop at the Besakih Temple.
